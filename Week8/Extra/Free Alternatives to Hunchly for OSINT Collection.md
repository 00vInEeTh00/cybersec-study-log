   - **Use Case**: Capturing ephemeral content like phishing sites for security investigations.

## Additional Free Tools for Enhanced OSINT

Combine these with other open-source tools from the OSINT Framework (osintframework.com) for a robust setup:
- **SingleFile (Browser Extension)**: Saves complete web pages as single HTML files locally for quick evidence snapshots.  
- **HTTrack**: Open-source website copier for mirroring sites for offline security analysis.  
- **ExifTool**: Command-line tool for extracting metadata from images/files, ideal for forensic OSINT.  
- **SpiderFoot (Open-Source Edition)**: Automates reconnaissance (e.g., IPs, domains) with local logging; free community version.

## Recommendations for Security Purposes

- **Anonymity Setup**: Use with Tor Browser or VPNs for anonymous captures. Store data in encrypted folders (e.g., via VeraCrypt, free).  
- **Workflow Example**: Use Vortimo/IntelHub for browsing captures, Zotero for organization, and ExifTool for metadata verification to replicate Hunchly’s workflow.  
- **Legal/Ethical Note**: Ensure compliance with laws (e.g., GDPR/CCPA) for ethical OSINT on public data only.  
- **Resources**: Check GitHub’s awesome-osint repository or osintframework.com for downloads and guides.

These tools are actively maintained as of September 2025 and are widely used in cybersecurity for free, local OSINT collection.
