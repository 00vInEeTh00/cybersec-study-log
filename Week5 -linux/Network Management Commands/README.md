| `ip a`          | Shows all IP addresses and interfaces (modern tool).   |
| `ping`          | Tests network connectivity to another host.            |
| `netstat -tuln` | Lists open ports and listening services (deprecated).  |
| `ss -tuln`      | Shows open ports and connections (preferred over netstat). |

## üí° Tips
