## üß∞ Core Monitoring Commands

| **Command**     | **Purpose**                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `uptime`        | Shows system uptime and load averages.           |
| `top`           | Displays real-time CPU, memory, and process usage. |
| `df -h`         | Displays disk space usage.                       |
| `du -sh /path`  | Shows the size of a specific folder or file.     |
| `free -h`       | Displays RAM and swap usage.                     |
| `vmstat 1 5`    | Shows performance metrics like CPU, memory, and I/O. |

## üß™ Example Script: `sys_monitor.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "===== SYSTEM MONITORING REPORT ====="

echo "1. Uptime:"
uptime
echo

echo "2. CPU & Memory Usage (top):"
top -b -n 1 | head -n 10
echo

echo "3. Disk Usage (df -h):"
df -h
echo

echo "4. Folder Size (/var/log):"
du -sh /var/log 2>/dev/null
echo

echo "5. RAM Usage (free -h):"
free -h
echo

echo "6. Performance Stats (vmstat):"
vmstat 1 5
echo

echo "===== END OF REPORT ====="






##üõ†Ô∏è Optional / Advanced Tools (But Very Useful)

###These tools offer more detailed or interactive system monitoring:
Tool	Description	Install (Ubuntu/Debian)
htop	Interactive system monitor (better than top)	sudo apt install htop
iotop	Real-time disk I/O per process	sudo apt install iotop
iostat	CPU and disk throughput stats (sysstat package)	sudo apt install sysstat
glances	Full monitoring dashboard (web + CLI)	sudo apt install glances
sar	Collects and displays historical performance data	sudo apt install sysstat
nmon	Performance monitoring tool with charts	sudo apt install nmon
dstat	Replaces vmstat, iostat, and ifstat with one tool	sudo apt install dstat
