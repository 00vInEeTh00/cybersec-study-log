The CIA triad is the foundation of information security, consisting of
Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Each principle ensures
that information is protected in a specific way.

1.  **Confidentiality**\
    Keeping information private and only accessible to authorized users\
    **Example:**\

-   Employee records in a company are stored in a secure database. Only
    HR staff can access them.\
-   Emails are encrypted so that only the recipient can read them.

2.  **Integrity**\
    Ensuring information is accurate, complete, and unaltered\
    **Example:**\

-   Bank account balances must not be changed by unauthorized users. Any
    transfer is logged and verified.\
-   Software updates are digitally signed to prevent tampering.

3.  **Availability**\
    Making information accessible to authorized users when needed\
    **Example:**\

-   Online banking systems must be up and running 24/7 for customers.\
-   Cloud storage services ensure files are accessible even if one
    server fails (using backups and redundancy).

### Importance in Real-World Security:

-   Organizations use the CIA triad to guide security policies and
    technologies.\
-   It helps prevent data breaches, fraud, downtime, and operational
    losses.
